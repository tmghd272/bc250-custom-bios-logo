BC250 BIOS custom boot logo theme — AMI OEM tool “ChangeLogo.exe” included for DIY logo modification

# AMD BC-250 Custom AMI BIOS Logo

The ROM file still contains the unlocked chipset menu of P3.00, it just comes with the custom boot logo I made.

You can make your own custom logo as well using AMI's software "CustomLogo.exe".

From my experience, the best image logo format is:

BMP File Format

24-bit bit depth

672 × 378 (16:9)

96 DPI

Use black backgrounds — don’t use transparent backgrounds because it could cause visual glitches in the logo itself.
